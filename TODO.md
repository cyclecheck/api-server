## TODO

Tasks to do in no specific order

### Nice to have

- Admin endpoints
  - Check how many API calls were made to darksky
- Create service/module for getting DarkSky stats
- Add Openstreetmap as an alternative to google maps
- Add ability to pass flags to the command line
  - Like path to config, port, etc.
- Add env option for github token, so that we can use the gh api without limits

### Deploy

- Somehow have a webhook or something to trigger a new release on the webserver
